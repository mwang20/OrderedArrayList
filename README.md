# OrderedArrayList

## Our breakout room group discussed the NoNullArrayList. We talked about if NoNullArrayList and if it wanted to remove the null values from the ArrayList or if it was going to throw an exception when it detected a null value in the ArrayList. We also discussed whether it would check the values inside the ArrayList for null values or check the values we are adding to the ArrayList for null values. We said that it would be checking the values being added to the ArrayList, because at the beginning the ArrayList would have no values inside. We said to use super method and add the values to the ArrayList using super.add(). We also discussed what types of objects we could add to the ArrayList. Anything thats not null. We said we would create an array and add all the objects to the array, and then use a for loop to check the indexes of the array. A misconception we had was that we were going to use greater than equal to or less than operators to compare the objects of the array, but instead we said we were going to use the compareTo method since OrderedArrayList extended comparable. Using the for loop and compareTo we would add the smallest to largest elements of the array to the ArrayList while checking for null values if they were being added.
